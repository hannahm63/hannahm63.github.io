# Personal Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio for potential employers, fellow developers, and others who are generally curious to view applications I have built and contributed to.

Take a look at the deployed version here: hannahm63.github.io

## Coming Soon
Currently this portfolio is built out using HTML, Bootstrap, some custom CSS, and JavaScript. In the future I will transition it over to React or a similar framework.
